# CRUD App (Demo)

A minimal Node.js Express CRUD demo app with an in-memory store.

Endpoints:
- GET /items
- GET /items/:id
- POST /items
- PUT /items/:id
- DELETE /items/:id

To run:

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Use `curl` or a tool like Postman to hit endpoints.

Note: This repository includes a feature branch `feature/add-search-endpoint` and a PR demo to show GitHub merge behavior.
